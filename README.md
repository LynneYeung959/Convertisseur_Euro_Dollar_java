# Convertisseur_Euro_Dollar_java

The goal of this project is to realize a graphic converter Euros/Dollars. With the following features:
- If the user enters a value in the euro box and validates (enter key) then the corresponding amount in dollars is calculated and displayed in the corresponding box, in addition an arrow => is displayed to indicate the direction of the conversion.
- Likewise with the euro box (and an arrow <=).
- The user must also be able to change the exchange rate using the arrows of a JSpinner button (see image below).
- Finally, if the user closes the window or clicks quit the program execution terminates.
- Incorrect entries will be handled by exceptions.
